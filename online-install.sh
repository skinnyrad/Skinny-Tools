# Title: Git Repository Live Online Installer (Python, Security Tools, & Payloads)
# Author: Jeff Benson (erg0Pr0xy) - Skinny Research & Development
#
# Install flow:
#   0.  S/H/B selector: choose Skinny-Tools, Hak5 library/ payloads, or both
#   1.  Internet connectivity check
#   1A. Hak5 payload pull (H or B only) - fetches
#         github.com/hak5/wifipineapplepager-payloads/library and merges
#         new payload folders into /mmc/root/payloads/ (no-clobber)
#   1B. Skinny-Tools source resolution (S or B only) - ALWAYS fetches the
#         latest from github.com/skinnyrad/Skinny-Pager-Payloads so Phase
#         3-5 operate on upstream HEAD, not on a possibly-stale local
#         clone. The fetched content is cached at
#         /mmc/root/.skinny-tools-cache/skinny-tools/ and refreshed on
#         every successful run. Fallbacks in order: cached snapshot,
#         then the local clone at $REPO_DIR (only if both the GitHub
#         fetch and the cache are unavailable, e.g. truly offline).
#         This means users who only downloaded online-install.sh (no
#         local clone) get the same updates as users who maintain a
#         full clone - and they no longer have to remember to
#         `git pull` between runs.
#   2.  Pre-flight dependency check (tcpdump, aircrack-ng, python3)  [S/B only]
#   3.  Recursive .ipk discovery & install under cross-compiled-pager-tools/  [S/B only]
#   4.  Payload tree mirror with new-payload detection  [S/B only]
#   5.  Global pagerctl hardware-interface symlinks  [S/B only]
#   6.  Verification & summary  [S/B only]
#
# Uninstall phases (--uninstall):
#   U1. Remove cross-compiled .ipk packages
#   U2. Remove custom payload directories
#   U3. Remove pagerctl hardware-interface symlinks
#   U4. Summary

Usage: $0 [--uninstall] [--help] [--select S|H|B] [S|H|B]

Default (no flag):  Interactive prompt asks which payload sources to pull:
                      [S] Skinny-Tools (full install/update, identical to
                          prior behavior)
                      [H] Hak5 library/ payloads from
                          github.com/hak5/wifipineapplepager-payloads
                      [B] Both (Skinny-Tools + Hak5)
                   All payload merges use no-clobber semantics: only
                   missing payloads are copied, nothing on the Pager is
                   ever removed by this script.
  --uninstall, -u:   Remove all Skinny-Tools customizations (cross-compiled
                   tool .ipk packages, custom payload directories, and
                   PagerCTL hardware-interface symlinks). Preserves all
                   Hak5 factory payloads. Cross-compiled library packages
                   (lib* .ipk files) and pre-flight system packages
                   (python3, aircrack-ng, tcpdump, etc.) are NOT removed;
                   the summary lists the manual command to remove them
                   if a full factory reset is desired.
  --select S|H|B:    Non-interactive mode: skip the prompt and use the
                   given selection directly. Accepts "--select S",
                   "--select=S", or just "S" as a positional argument.
                   Used by the Skinny-Pager-Payload-Updater Pager-UI
                   menu payload so the menu always tracks this script.
--help, -h:        Show this help.

Run from inside the cloned Skinny-Tools repository so the script can
discover payloads/ and cross-compiled-pager-tools/. Hak5 payloads are
fetched directly from GitHub at install time and do not require the
Skinny-Tools repo to be present locally.

# Shared helper for payload tree-walking. Used by both Phase 1A (Hak5 fetch)
# and Phase 4 (Skinny-Tools mirror) so the two phases cannot drift in their
# iteration logic. For each payload subdir under $1 (src), installs it into
# $2 (dst root) using three-tier semantics:
#   - If the destination subdir doesn't exist: create it and copy the entire
#     payload contents (fresh install). Logs "[NEW PAYLOAD] <label>/<name>".
#   - If the destination subdir already exists: descend into it and for each
#     file compare content via sha256. Three sub-cases:
#       * File missing on dest: copy it. Logs
#         "[NEW FILE] <label>/<name>/<relpath>". The Pager ships empty
#         placeholder folders at /mmc/root/payloads/{alerts,recon/<subtree>,
#         user/<factory>}/<payload>/ that need to be populated with upstream
#         files on first run.
#       * File present but hash differs: overwrite with the upstream copy
#         (your latest repo push is the source of truth). Logs
#         "[UPDATED FILE] <label>/<name>/<relpath>".
#       * File present and hash matches: skip silently. Local tweaks are
#         preserved only as long as the upstream file content doesn't change.
#     If any file in the payload was added or changed, the whole label is
#     also logged once as "[UPDATED PAYLOAD] <label>/<name>".
# Updates the MERGE_NEW_LABELS, MERGE_UPDATED_LABELS, MERGE_PRESENT_LABELS,

# ==========================================
# PHASE 1B: Skinny-Tools Source Resolution (S/B only)
# ==========================================
# Strategy: always use upstream HEAD as the source of truth. The local
# clone sitting next to the script is treated as a last-resort fallback
# only - users who don't maintain a local copy (e.g. downloaded just
# online-install.sh from GitHub) will still pick up the maintainer's
# latest pushes without having to remember to `git pull` first.
#
# Fetch order:
#   1. Try to download the GitHub tarball. On success, refresh the
#      cache at /mmc/root/.skinny-tools-cache/skinny-tools/ and use it.
#   2. On download failure: fall back to the existing cache (if any).
#   3. If no cache: fall back to the local clone at $REPO_DIR (if
#      complete). Mark the fallback in the log so the user knows
#      they're running on potentially stale content.
#   4. If none of the above: critical error, exit.
