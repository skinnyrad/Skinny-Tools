# Title: Git Repository Live Online Installer (Python, Security Tools, & Payloads)
# Author: Jeff Benson (erg0Pr0xy) - Skinny Research & Development
#
# Install flow:
#   0.  S/H/B selector: choose Skinny-Tools, Hak5 library/ payloads, or both
#   1.  Internet connectivity check
#   1A. Hak5 payload pull (H or B only) - fetches
#         github.com/hak5/wifipineapplepager-payloads/library and merges
#         new payload folders into /mmc/root/payloads/ (no-clobber)
#   1B. Skinny-Tools repo auto-fetch (S or B only) - if a full local clone
#         isn't next to the script, fetches the GitHub tarball so Phase 3-5
#         have payloads/, cross-compiled-pager-tools/, pagerctl.{py,so} to
#         work with. Existing users with a full clone see no behavior change.
#   2.  Pre-flight dependency check (tcpdump, aircrack-ng, python3)  [S/B only]
#   3.  Recursive .ipk discovery & install under cross-compiled-pager-tools/  [S/B only]
#   4.  Payload tree mirror with new-payload detection  [S/B only]
#   5.  Global pagerctl hardware-interface symlinks  [S/B only]
#   6.  Verification & summary  [S/B only]
#
# Uninstall phases (--uninstall):
#   U1. Remove cross-compiled .ipk packages
#   U2. Remove custom payload directories
#   U3. Remove pagerctl hardware-interface symlinks
#   U4. Summary

Default (no flag):  Interactive prompt asks which payload sources to pull:
                      [S] Skinny-Tools (full install/update, identical to
                          prior behavior)
                      [H] Hak5 library/ payloads from
                          github.com/hak5/wifipineapplepager-payloads
                      [B] Both (Skinny-Tools + Hak5)
                   All payload merges use no-clobber semantics: only
                   missing payloads are copied, nothing on the Pager is
                   ever removed by this script.
  --uninstall, -u:   Remove all Skinny-Tools customizations (cross-compiled
                   tool .ipk packages, custom payload directories, and
                   PagerCTL hardware-interface symlinks). Preserves all
                   Hak5 factory payloads. Cross-compiled library packages
                   (lib* .ipk files) and pre-flight system packages
                   (python3, aircrack-ng, tcpdump, etc.) are NOT removed;
                   the summary lists the manual command to remove them
                   if a full factory reset is desired.
--help, -h:        Show this help.

Run from inside the cloned Skinny-Tools repository so the script can
discover payloads/ and cross-compiled-pager-tools/. Hak5 payloads are
fetched directly from GitHub at install time and do not require the
Skinny-Tools repo to be present locally.
